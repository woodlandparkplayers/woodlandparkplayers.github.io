		<h2>Cast</h2>
		<p>No experience is required to audition to be a cast member for a Woodland Park Players production,

			  <ul>
		<li>-  Approximately eight weeks of rehearsals and one weekend of performances. </li>
		<li>-  Lead roles typically require more time than secondary roles. Even so, there is some flexibility. </li>
		<li>-  Rehearsals can often be scheduled around conflicts as long as the director is advised during auditions.</li>
		</ul>
			  
			  
			  
	  		<h2>Costume Crew</h2>
	  		<p>The Costume Crew is responsible for making, collecting, borrowing, constructing, and designing the costumes for the production. 
	  		They work with the costume designer(the head of the costume crew) and director to make all of the costumes for the production. 
	  		They are also in charge of scheduling fittings/altercations for the whole cast. It is also necessary to have some of the costume crew 
	  		at each performance, to work with the stage manager to get everyones costumes in place, and be on hand if anything happens.</p>
		
		<h2>Set Production</h2>
		<p>We need lots of volunteers to help build and paint sets. There will be more on exactly what needs to be done soon.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Stage Hands</h2>
		<p>The Stage Hands work with the Stage Manager to move the props and sets around during the production. If you would like to help, you would 
		need to wear all black during the show and walk around backstage. If you helped both nights, you would not be able to see the show. This will 
		be updated further once we have more information.
