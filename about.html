	   <pre>    </pre><p>The Woodland Park Players was formed in 2015 by Linda Joss after she had been a part of a similar group in Ann Arbor, Michigan, called the Burns Park Players. 
	   When Linda returned home from Ann Arbor, she had a strong drive to recreate the Burns Park Players in Seattle. Linda shared her idea with her friends and it slowly
	    grew into a cast of 47 adults and a 20 piece orchestra! We cannot wait until the show is over and we can donate some of our profits to arts programs in Seattle. 
	    To become a member fo the Woodland Park Players, several requirements and duties must be met:
		<ul class = "abt">
		
		<li>Be an adult 18 years or older</li>
		<br>
		<li>Reside in the Woodland Park, Phinney Ridge, Wallingford, and Greenlake neighborhoods. </li>
		<br>
		<li>Pay annual dues of $25 per adult member, plus $10 for each additional household member. </li>
		<br>
		<li>Participate as a cast or crew member of the annual musical production, including promising to sell at least 10 tickets to the musical performances, as our main revenue source. </li>
		</ul>
		<pre>    </pre><p>	Woodland Park Players was formed by a small group of parents looking for a way to find greater community and 
		raise funds for art programs in the Seattle Public Schools. The Woodland Park Players has grown in a short 
		time, into an active community theater company that committed itself to family-oriented musical productions 
		as well as to support our local schools. 
		According to our by-laws, the Players is a group of adult members (parents, teachers, other residents) who live 
		in the Woodland Park neighborhood and who join together to produce a musical show each year. 
		In addition, the Players must donate its proceeds to school or school district needs. 
		Woodland Park Players dues are $25/person, and new members are always welcome. </p>
