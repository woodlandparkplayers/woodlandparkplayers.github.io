	   <h1>About</h1>
	   <p class="footer-padding">Woodland Park Players was formed by a small group of parents looking for a way to find greater community and 
		raise funds for art programs in the Seattle Public Schools. The Woodland Park Players has grown in a short 
		time, into an active community theater company that committed itself to family-oriented musical productions 
		as well as to support our local schools. <br>
		According to our by-laws, the Players is a group of adult members (parents, teachers, other residents) who live 
		in the Woodland Park neighborhood and who join together to produce a musical show each year. 
		In addition, the Players must donate its proceeds to school or school district needs. 
		Woodland Park Players dues are annually $40/person, and new members are always welcome. </p>
